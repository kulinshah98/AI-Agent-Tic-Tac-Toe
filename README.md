# AI-Agent-for-Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
An AI agent implemented using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using Upper Confidence Bounds (UCT).

### Game Description
- Basic game is - https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-original-post/  
- But instead of 3\*3, it is 4\*4

### Resources for MCTS and UCT

### Test
- Participated in AI tournament(![rules](/problem_statement.pdf)) in which total 90 teams participated. Qualified for semifinals along with 30 teams.
- Semifinals had 3 pools each having 10 teams. Secured 5th rank in semifinals.

### Scope of improvement
- Backpropogation step of MCTS properly to store heuristic
- Implementation in C++ instead of Python for more number of simulations
- Evaluation function
